Different Sizes of Infinity

Mathematics has shown that the concept of 'infinity' isn't monolithic; there are actually different,
distinct sizes of infinity. It's been proven that the infinity of all points on a continuous line (the
real numbers) is fundamentally 'larger' than the infinity of all whole numbers (1, 2, 3...), even though
both sets go on forever without end.

Looking Back in Time

Because light travels at a vast but finite speed, we never see the universe as it exists right now. When
we observe distant stars or galaxies, we are actually seeing them as they were when the light began its
journey. Looking at the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, means we see it as it appeared
2.5 million years in the past. Essentially, telescopes act as time machines, allowing us to witness
cosmic history.

Earth's Protective Shield
</button>
</h2>

<div class="kds-accordion-body">
Deep beneath our feet, the churning motion of molten iron in Earth's liquid outer core acts like a giant
dynamo, generating our planet's magnetic field. This invisible field extends far into space, forming a
protective shield (the magnetosphere) that deflects the majority of harmful charged particles streaming
from the sun (the solar wind). Without this geologically generated shield, solar radiation would strip
away our atmosphere and make surface life impossible.
